	   Whatâ€™s the Problem?
			Java arrays are covariant: Dog[] is a subtype of Animal[], so the compiler allows addAnimal(Dog[]).
			But at runtime, the actual array is still a Dog[], not a general Animal[].
			So when animals[0] = new Cat(); is executed:
			You're trying to put a Cat into a Dog[] array.
			Java throws an ArrayStoreException.
